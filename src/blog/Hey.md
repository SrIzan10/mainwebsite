# Hey!

This is probably the last time I'm going to make a blog. I've made a few in the past, but I've never really stuck to them. I'm hoping that this time will be different.  
This one was made entirely from scratch using React and Markdown, initially trying to use MDX, but it was a pain to set up, and it didn't end up working in the end.  
I'm hoping to post about my projects, and maybe some other stuff too. I'm not sure yet, but I'll figure it out as I go along.  
Anyways, thank you for reading. I hope you enjoyed my UX/UI for this one!  

PD: I need some help for making the blog text look good and readable, so hit me up on my Discord if you have any ideas.
