# Sr Izan's Website
---
This is the source code for my main website: [srizan.ml](https://srizan.ml).
In that website I host files to download and docs for my projects.
(Yes I could put it on the [Wiki](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/about-wikis) page of my repo, but... Yeah, I like more HTML.)
