# Sr Izan's Website
---
This is the source code for my main website: [srizan.ml](https://srizan.ml).
In that website I host files to download and docs for my projects.
(Yes I could put it on the [Wiki](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/about-wikis) page of my repo, but.. Yeah, I like more HTML.)
Down here I'll put all the changelogs starting from [here](https://github.com/SrIzan10/mainwebsite/commit/1437d8079bae51bfb73e9f89487cec0325608040).
