    <h1>Welcome back!</h1>
    <p>You'll probably know me from https://srizan.ml, and now that domain is dead forever.</p>
    <h1>What happened?</h1>
    <p>Freenom being Freenom decided to expire my domain and when I wanted to re-register it, it would just not let me!</p>
    <p>While doing some research, I found that IANA had some problems with Freenom and probably just removed them off their registrar list. Just speculating :)</p>
    <h1>If I have a link that is yours, what do I have to do to view its contents?</h1>
    <p>Even though I'm still migrating stuff, the most critical subdomains for me like img.srizan.ml should be migrated by now, so probably you could just replace <code>.ml</code> with <code>.dev</code></p>
    <h1>Email?</h1>
    <p>It'll be shortly <code>izan at srizan dot dev</code> but it's not set up yet</p>
    <h1>thanks for reading... i guess</h1>
